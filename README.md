Doordash sample app

There is lots of room for improvement.

We can save the data in a db (room) for limiting the no of requests and using less data plus
resources.
We can use rxjava with retrofit or coroutines as i mentioned in the code.
We could also clean up and improve the UI to complement the sign-up screen.
login screen to compliment signup screen plus working login signup which saves the state of the user
for ex in shared preference for starters.
More adventurous thing would be pagination for fetching data beyong 50 or 100 items.
